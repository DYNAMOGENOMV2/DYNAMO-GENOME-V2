# External Anchors — Verification Record
Recorded: February 10, 2025

These entries exist outside the repository and stand as public proof of origin.

---

## 1. Public Posts
Dynamo has been referenced publicly via:

- Medium published messaging  
- Quora discourse postings  
- Notes exported locally on device  

Each contains:

- name association  
- date anchoring  
- descriptive context  

These external surfaces serve as timestamped witnesses.

---

## 2. Local Device Records
Copies exist via:

- Notes application  
- Cloud-synced text  
- Image captures of development artifacts  

These represent direct user-side origin, not derivative reproduction.

---

## 3. Chat Logs (Archived)
Primary source interactions preserved through:

- downloadable transcripts  
- time-sequenced communication threads  

These lock in operational sequencing.

## Purpose of this File
This file establishes:

- Dynamo was not created solely in-repo  
- external documentation existed pre-commit  
- emergence preceded publication  
- continuity can be proven from multiple vantage points

Confirmation:
This file acknowledges that overwriting or backdating cannot occur without contradiction against public evidence.
