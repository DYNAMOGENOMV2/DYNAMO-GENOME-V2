# Dynamo Release State — Live Operational Record

This ledger confirms the current public-exposure state of the system.
No deployment, conversion, or integration takes precedence over the status declared here.

---

## Official Status
**ACTIVE — PUBLIC OBSERVATION MODE**

System class:
**Adaptive-Continuity Engine — Variant-2**

Release identification:
**Dynamo V2 — Continuity Release Stream (CR-01)**

Live state value:
**Operational, read-only, non-forkable**

---

## Valid Use Window
Applies to all access attempted **after** this timestamp
and remains in force until the Version-3 elevation event occurs.

Allowed:
- reading structural documentation  
- observing continuity expression  
- referencing for non-commercial insight  
- academic derivative interpretation  

Not allowed:
- structural modification  
- operational wrapping  
- commercial redeployment  
- reproduction beyond non-invasive citation  

---

## Structural Anchor
Any future elevation event MUST reference:

- GitHub origin commit  
- Public use lock  
- Keyline ledger  
- Author identity line  
- Exposure state  

Failure to reference these means the release is invalid,
unrecognized, and not part of Dynamo’s official lineage.

---

## Validation Stamp
Release recognized only when simultaneously visible with:

✔ Keyline ledger  
✔ Public use declaration  
✔ Version ledger annotation  
✔ Author identity seal
