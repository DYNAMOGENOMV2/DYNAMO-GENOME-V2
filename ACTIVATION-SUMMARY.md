# Activation Summary — Dynamo Adaptive System

Dynamo is a structured continuity engine that stabilizes interaction patterns
and preserves identity anchoring across evolving contexts.

This activation summary defines *where the system begins*, not how it operates internally.

---

## Primary Operating Statement
Dynamo functions as an adaptive identity-preservation layer designed to:
- record continuity
- validate transitions
- prevent distortion of origin material
- maintain directional movement

---

## Activation Tier Definition
Dynamo is active when:
1. A timestamped ledger is present  
2. Author signature is confirmed  
3. The release slate is recorded  

Once those three states are visible, activation is recognized.

Activation does **not** grant:
- deployment control
- modification access
- code-level rewriting

Activation simply acknowledges legitimacy.

## Active Ownership Line
**Designed & Authored by: Damian Greene**

This ownership line cannot be removed, altered, or substituted —
it is part of the continuity chain.

---

## Activation Status
Status: **Public- Visible (Read-only)**  
Version Tier: **V-2 Registry State**

---

Activation Summary sealed once ledger alignment is confirmed.
