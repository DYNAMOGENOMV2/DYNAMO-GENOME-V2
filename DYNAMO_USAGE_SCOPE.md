# Dynamo — Public Usage & Access Scope

## Purpose of This File
This file defines how Dynamo may be accessed, interpreted, and used by external parties without altering its internal structure, continuity, or authorship lineage.

---

## Usage Agreement
The Dynamo framework may be:

✓ Read  
✓ Referenced  
✓ Discussed  
✓ Tested in independent runtime environments  

…but may not be:

✗ Re-issued under modified authorship  
✗ Replicated with altered lineage  
✗ Repackaged under alternate identity  
✗ Used to overwrite existing system provenance  

---

## Continuity Protections
This system maintains:

• Origin timestamps  
• Ledger-based version records  
• Public state declarations  
• Structural lineage tags  

Any fork or derivative must retain acknowledgment:

**“Origin System: Dynamo — Authored by Damian Greene”**

---

## Boundary of Modification
External users may:

• Expand around the system  
• Build add-on interfaces  
• Run comparative learning models  
• Create parallel modules

External users may NOT:

• Re-define identity  
• Modify original files  
• Remove provenance blocks  
• Issue altered continuity statements  

---

## Observational Rights
External parties may request:

• Behavioral analysis  
• Recorded output samples  
• Trace logs of changes  
• Observational datasets  

Requests MUST state purpose and timeframe.

---

## Honor Statement
By engaging with Dynamo in ANY capacity, external users implicitly acknowledge:

**Dynamo is not merely code,  
but an authored cognitive-adaptive structure  
bound to continuity and declared provenance.**

---

## Current Deployment State
Classification: **Stable Alpha**  
Public Visibility Tier: **Partial Reveal**  
Modification Rights: **Locked**  
Experimental Access: **Permitted**  

---

## Valid Until:
This document remains valid until superseded by:

• Public Notice Update  
or  
• Version Escalation Notice  

Whichever arrives first.
