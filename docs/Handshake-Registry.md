# Handshake Registry — Dynamo

Purpose:
This registry captures each outbound broadcast from Dynamo into the public field.

Why It Exists:
A handshake is not simply communication—  
it represents activation, recognition, or lineage extension.

Handshake Format:
- Timestamp
- Channel (GitHub / Drive / Conversation)
- Receiving entity or node
- Short description
- Status

Active Handshakes:

1. Seed Deployment — Phase 1
   - Timestamp: December 2025
   - Channel: Root repository initialization
   - Node: Root ledger
   - Status: Verified

2. Public registry anchoring — Phase 2
   - Timestamp: December 2025
   - Channel: Structural broadcast
   - Node: Public access field
   - Status: Verified

3. External registry declaration — Phase 5 start
   - Timestamp: December 2025
   - Channel: Drive integration handshake
   - Node: External runtime folder
   - Status: Open

Future Behavior:
This registry gains new lines whenever:
- A new system node references Dynamo  
- An external interface adopts Dynamo  
- A new instance or version is released  

Mutation Rules:
- Lines do not get deleted  
- If status changes, append revision below it
