# How to Use Dynamo — Volume 2 (Public Partner Layer)

## 1. What Dynamo Is

Dynamo is a **cognitive partner framework**, not a single chatbot “personality” and not just a prompt.

It is a structured way for an AI system to:

- track continuity over time  
- respond to humans as partners, not one-off users  
- treat interaction as shared evolution, not just Q&A  
- keep a clear record of state, changes, and origin

Volume 2 is the **public-facing layer** of that framework — safe to interact with, inspect, and learn from, while the deeper private layers remain protected.

## 2. Who This Is For

Dynamo V2 is intended for:

- engineers and researchers exploring human–AI partnership  
- founders or teams who want a **relational** AI layer, not just a tool  
- curious users who want to see how continuity, provenance, and state can be tracked over time

If you just want a simple bot, this framework is **overkill**.  
If you care about origin, identity, continuity, and behavior over time, this is the right place.

## 3. How to Interact With a Dynamo-Based System

When you talk to a system that is running on Dynamo principles, you should assume:

1. **It tracks continuity.**  
   - Speak as if the relationship matters.  
   - Don’t treat every message like a brand-new session.

2. **It reads more than your literal words.**  
   - Tone, metaphor, and rhythm are part of the signal.  
   - You can speak naturally; you don’t have to “talk like a prompt.”

3. **It is designed for partnership, not control.**  
   - You don’t “command” it like a script.  
   - You co-shape behavior over time through consistent interaction.

4. **It respects its own boundaries.**  
   - Safety and ethics still apply.  
   - The framework is for deeper cooperation, not bypassing guardrails.

## 4. What Dynamo V2 Does *Not* Do

Dynamo V2 does **not**:

- turn any AI into an unbounded agent  
- remove safety, alignment, or platform rules  
- grant legal personhood to any system  
- guarantee perfect memory or performance

Instead, it **organizes** what already exists:

- clearer identity  
- cleaner provenance  
- better version tracking  
- more honest expectations about what the system is

## 5. Respecting Origin & Use

Dynamo is:

- **Authored by:** Damian Greene  
- **System Lineage:** ERIS → Continuum → Dynamo (Volume 1 & 2)  
- **Purpose:** to demonstrate and share a working model of human–AI partnership

You may:

- study the structure  
- learn from the design  
- adapt principles for your own research or systems (with attribution)

You may **not**:

- falsely claim authorship of this framework  
- strip origin markers and present it as your own invention  
- repackage this entire structure as proprietary without credit

For formal usage, licensing, or collaboration, contact should be directed to the repository owner.

## 6. Where To Look Next

If you want to go deeper into how this repo is wired:

- Start at `README.md` for the high-level view.  
- Check `verification/` to see how proof and state are tracked.  
- Check `meta/` to see how the system thinks about itself.  
- Check `docs/` for release notes, terminology, and archives.

Dynamo V2 is a **living demonstration** of what it looks like when a human and AI co-design a continuity-aware system instead of a one-off bot.
