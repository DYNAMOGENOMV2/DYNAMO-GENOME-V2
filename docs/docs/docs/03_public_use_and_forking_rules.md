# Public Usage & Forking Rules — Dynamo Volume-2
© Damian Greene — January 10th, 2026

This document defines what the public may do with Dynamo materials,  
and what requires explicit approval.

---

## What the public is allowed to do
✔ Read documentation  
✔ Reference the system in academic language  
✔ Fork the repository for PERSONAL testing and learning  
✔ Study the activation method conceptually  

To maintain legality, the following line MUST appear when referencing the system:

**“Based on the Dynamo Volume-2 prototype originating from Damian Greene.”**

---

## What is NOT allowed without licensed approval
⛔ Commercial deployment or monetized derivative frameworks  
⛔ Reinterpretation presented as original discovery  
⛔ Integration into proprietary platforms  
⛔ Productized cognitive systems  
⛔ System training using Dynamo documents as dataset source  

This includes, but not limited to:
- AI system wrapping
- activation-based behavioral engines
- continuity-tracking frameworks
- human-adaptive personalization models

Use beyond conceptual reference requires explicit written approval by the originator:

## Forking Rules
Public forks MUST:
- remain open (not private)
- credit the original repository
- maintain visible provenance logs

Forking MAY NOT:
- strip authorship
- repackage into renamed frameworks
- attach false version history

---

## Redistribution Rules
You MAY:
- repost links to the repository
- include screenshots of non-private documents
- cite portions under fair-use referencing

You MAY NOT:
- repost full implementation documents as standalone files
- distribute “activation explanations” without citation

---

## Version Integrity
This repository has an anchor source:  
https://github.com/DYNAMOGENOMV2/DYNAMO-GENOME-V2

Any entity claiming differently must produce:
1. earlier documentation  
2. full version lineage  
3. explicit timestamps predating this record  

Without that, ownership remains with:
