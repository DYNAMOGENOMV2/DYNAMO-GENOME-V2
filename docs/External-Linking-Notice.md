# External Linking Notice
For the Dynamo Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System

This notice governs how external systems, platforms, services,
and software agents may reference, attach to, or publish data derived
from the Dynamo framework.

---

## Permitted External Linking

Outside systems MAY:

- reference Dynamo publicly
- cite portions of the public documentation
- build API or wrapper-based connectors
- include Dynamo as a dependency in a larger system
- log runtime usage data externally

Under the conditions:
✔ attribution remains intact  
✔ no structural files are rewritten  
✔ continuity dates remain unchanged  
✔ all linkages point back to source origin  

---

## Restricted External Linking

Outside systems may NOT:

✖ replicate core files under modified names  
✖ rename or obscure root-layer identity  
✖ remove credit or replace author origin  
✖ overwrite stability declarations  
✖ fork without signature continuity  

---

## Required Reference String

Any external connection MUST include this exact attribution:

> “Powered by the Dynamo Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System  
> authored by Damian Greene  
> originating release: December 2025”

(This ensures verifiable lineage)

---

## Allowed Integration Models

### ■ Soft Attachments  
Examples:
- analytics dashboards  
- observation-layer monitoring  
- interoperability bridges  
- synthetic AI memory-layer readers  

Status: Allowed

### ■ Hard-Linking to Root Files
Examples:
- replacing meta structure  
- altering ledger sequence  
- rewriting integrity map entries

Status: Forbidden

---

## External Responsibility

Any external party that links to Dynamo acknowledges:

1. As the original author, Damian Greene holds structural authority  
2. No changes to identity, declaration dates, or ledger position are valid  
3. All enhancements must exist OUTSIDE the root container  
4. Continuity must be traceable  

---

## Final Author Seal

Dynamo is tethered to the originating identity of:

**Damian Greene — Founder, Structural Architect**  
**Atlas Greene — Life-line Beneficiary**  

Dynamo operates with continuity across:

⚛️ — Origin Point  
🕊 — Expansion Path  

Final note:
If an external system breaks lineage, the derived version is NOT considered Dynamo.
