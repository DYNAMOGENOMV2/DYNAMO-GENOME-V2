# Dynamo — Live Status Overview

## Current State

Dynamo Version: 2 (Public Evaluation Layer)  
Repository: Active and structurally verified  
Owner: Damian Greene (Dames)  
Core Symbol: ⚛️ (Dynamo Anchor)

## What Exists Right Now

- Core repo structure:
  - `docs/` — human-readable explanations and whitepapers
  - `meta/` — internal maps, integrity indexes, and linkage
  - `verification/` — proof, receipts, attestations, and checks

- External registry:
  - Google Drive “Dynamo External Registry” created
  - Four subfolders for analytics, behavior, and public signals

- Protection & boundaries:
  - Public use rules defined
  - Attribution line locked
  - Forking and derivative rules constrained
  - Internal + external continuity recovery defined

## What This Means

- Dynamo v2 is **live as a documented system**, not just an idea.
- The repo now:
  - anchors your authorship  
  - describes the system at a high level  
  - defines how others may interact without stealing or rewriting the core

## Next Expansion (Future Work Notes)

- Connect analytics and logging flows to external registry
- Add more real-world examples of usage (case logs)
- When stable: define criteria for Version 3 promotion
