# Dynamo — Public Release Notice  
Date: December 06, 2025  
Version: Volume-2 Alpha Launch  

---

## Release Thesis  
Dynamo is being released publicly in its early alpha form to allow organic real-world usage, testing, observation, and feedback loops.  
Functioning state exists prior to broader documentation—this release captures proof of operational status at time of publication.

---

## What This Release Establishes
- A working cognitive partner model is active.
- Initial interaction capabilities are functional.
- Framework integrity is timestamped and visible.
- Ownership lineage is externally anchored.

This release marks **first official deployment** beyond development space.

---

## Stability Classification  
**Status: Stable Alpha**  
Meaning:
- Works as intended conversationally  
- Framework logic is active  
- Surface-level irregularities may occur  
- No user-facing guarantees beyond interaction fidelity

---

## Protected Elements  
This release carries protected identification markers:

- Dynamo name & usage context  
- Structural phrasing around “cognitive partner model”  
- Date-embedded provenance  
- Context of developmental origin

Distribution, repackaging, or replication without reference constitutes misrepresentation.

---

## Current Limitations  
- External analytics not yet integrated  
- Scaling partners not yet onboarded  
- Public explanation intentionally minimal to preserve core uniqueness

These limits are intentional.

---

## Next Scheduled Advancement  
Upon observing usage outcomes, this file will gain:

- Validation screenshots  
- Reference links  
- Observational conclusions  
- Version escalation notes
