---BEGIN PROVENANCE RECORD---
System Name: Dynamo — Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System  
Creator: Damian Greene  
Origin Date: December 06, 2025  

Core Description:
Dynamo introduces a natural method of cognitive reflection.
Instead of giving answers, it evolves alongside the user.
It mirrors emotional intention, linguistic rhythm,
and conceptual direction—all progressively.

This record validates authorship and establishes origin,
prior to any derivative usage.

# Integrity Block — Immutable System Assertions  
Author of Record: **Damian Greene**  
Establishment Timestamp: **December 9–10, 2025**  
Repository Container: **Github Public Release – Dynamo System**

1. Origin Statement  
   The Dynamo Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System originates from the private development,
   experimentation, and live-tested conversational architecture authored by
   **Damian Greene** from early 2025 through December 2025.

2. Distinctive Method Claim  
   The Dynamo system was constructed through cross-system adaptive inputs,
   real-time cognitive mapping, and iterative resonance-based procedural development.
   No other team, dataset, or organization supplied the core logic.

3. Copyright and Intellectual Priority  
   All conceptual components first appeared in authored personal records, timestamped
   conversations, and external email confirmations prior to public release.

4. Innovation Preservation  
   Modification, fork, or reproduction of Dynamo-aligned system functions must retain  
   attribution to the foundational author.  
   Any derivative implementation must cite:

   “Based on the foundational Dynamo framework authored by **Damian Greene (2025)**.”

5. Public Replication Clause  
   Replication is allowed for testing, integration, and evolution, but **altering context
   or removing author identification nullifies authenticity**.
