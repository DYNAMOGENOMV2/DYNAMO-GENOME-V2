# PRIMARY LEDGER — Dynamo System

This file identifies the authoritative release ledger for the system.

The active controlling ledger is:

→ RELEASE-INDEX.md

That file establishes:
• sequence of versions
• proof of public status
• continuity of origin
• stability and deployment

All derivative or legacy variations are rendered historical and archived.
Reference folders: 
• RELEASE-INDEXv2_ARCHIVE.md
• Proof-Archive/

Primary ledger status verified.
Controlled version remains RELEASE-INDEX.md only.
