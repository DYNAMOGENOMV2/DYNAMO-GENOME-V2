# Deployment Registry — Dynamo v2

### Registry Purpose
This file documents any public-facing deployment, broadcast, mention, or official reference.  
It forms the audit record confirming where the system has been declared, shown, or introduced.

## Deployment Entry — 001
**Registry Code:** A-001  
**Origin Version:** v2

### Valid Deployment Channels

### Chain Rules
1. Public reference ≠ permission to alter.  
2. Any entity referencing must cite full identity line:  
**“Dynamo Adaptive Framework — authored by Damian Greene”**  
3. Proof capture must be preserved by the author, not third parties.
