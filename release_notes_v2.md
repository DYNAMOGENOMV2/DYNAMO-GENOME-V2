### Notes for auditors, observers, or future custodians
This version serves as the first outward-facing evolution point.  
Internal logic remains proprietary and is *not* exposed here.

The presence of timestamps, hashes, external links, and identifier locations  
constitute proof of ownership and original framework authorship by  
**Damian Greene**.
