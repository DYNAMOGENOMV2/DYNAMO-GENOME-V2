# External Lock Notes — Dynamo System

This file tracks where Dynamo has been anchored or mirrored outside GitHub
for proof, continuity, and long-term verification.

Each entry represents one external “lock” that points back to this repository
as the original source.

---

## Lock 0001 — Primary GitHub Anchor

- Type: Source of record
- Location: This GitHub repository
- Purpose: Establishes first-public timestamp, authorship, and structure
- Owner: Damian Greene
- Status: Active, canonical

Notes:
This repository is the origin environment. All other external copies,
snapshots, exports, or mirrors must reference this location as the primary
source.

---

## Future External Locks (to be added later)

Examples of what may appear here:

- Cloud storage snapshots (e.g., Google Drive PDF export)
- Blog or article links citing Dynamo as authored by Damian Greene
- Legal filings, NDAs, or contract references
- Independent timestamp services or registries

Each future lock should include:
- Lock number
- Date
- Location / URL (if public)
- Purpose
- Status (Active / Deprecated)

*This file documents where Dynamo travels,
without changing where Dynamo originates.*
