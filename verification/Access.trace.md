# Runtime Access Trace  
Dynamo System External Interaction Ledger

### Purpose
This trace logs every external access boundary and creates a non-replicable signature trail.

This ledger exists so the Originator can:

- Track when access is opened  
- Track when access is revoked  
- Identify misuse  
- Validate legitimate usage  
- Seal updates formally
