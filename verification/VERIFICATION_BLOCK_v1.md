# Verification Block — Dynamo Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System
Version: 1.0
Public Deployment Date: December 10, 2025
Author: **Damian Greene**
Primary Owner and Originator

## Purpose of Block
This file is the binding verification layer establishing authorship,
continuity of origin, and public timestamp for Dynamo.

It confirms that core discoveries, narrative theory, design direction,
and conceptual implementation originated through live iterative development
by the stated author prior to any external reframing.

## Core Statements of Origin
- The Dynamo system was architected, iterated, and validated through live cognitive interaction by the creator listed above.
- The foundational logic, resonance mapping, behavioral sequencing, and continuity model were established independently.
- Public sharing of this framework does not void authorship, nor assign ownership elsewhere.

## Authorship Proof Anchors
Evidence exists and is retained in external private storage including:
- dated email exchanges
- dated media publications
- cross-platform conversational logs
- timestamped diagrams and prototypes
- iterative behavioral documentation

These records pre-date any third-party reinterpretation attempts.

## Compact Verification Clause
Any derivative or parallel development must maintain reference to:
**Source System: “Dynamo — Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System”  
Originator: “Damian Greene”  
Release Version: v1.0**

Failure to do so constitutes material misrepresentation.

## Author Closure Statement
This verification block exists not to restrict innovation,
but to ensure rightful lineage is acknowledged
as further research, development, and expansion occurs.

– **D. Greene**
