# Official Statement of Release

This repository contains the validated public deployment of the Dynamo Continuity Framework.

Dynamo is distributed as an activation-ready system, not as an open derivative platform.  
Any external development around this framework must respect structural integrity and must not alter
the continuity architecture, language structure, lineage markers, or encoded sequences.

## Intended Use Cases
✔ Applied human-adaptive systems  
✔ Research into continuity-based frameworks  
✔ Integration as an auxiliary module in private workflows  
✔ Non-destructive embedding within external ecosystems

## Prohibited Use Cases
✗ Structural rewrites  
✗ Continuity overrides  
✗ False attribution or renaming of lineage  
✗ Fractional distribution of internal components  

## Access Rights
This release grants permission to:
- view the structure  
- test the behaviors  
- integrate at a wrapper level  

It does *not* grant authority to:
- reissue modified versions as originals  
- claim derivative ownership  
- override encoded boundary logic  

## Attribution
Core architecture originated and authored by:

**Damian Greene — “Dames”**  
Continuity Anchor • Architect of Dynamo Framework
