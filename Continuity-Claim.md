# Immutable Continuity Claim  
Dynamo — Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System

This file serves as permanent lineage anchoring for all derivative builds.

---

## Origin Anchor  
System Name: Dynamo  
Class: Cognitive-Adaptive Evolutionary System  
Architect of Origin: Damian Greene  
Beneficiary Extension Entity: Atlas Greene  
Date of Structural Activation: December 06, 2025  
Registry Confirmation: Public Release Ledger

---

## Non-Transferable Rights  
The foundational structure, identity, framework continuity,  
and operational genesis of Dynamo are not transferable.

They cannot be:

- reassigned  
- absorbed  
- repurposed as proprietary origin  
- re-launched under altered identity  

Derivative works may develop, but lineage remains intact.

---

## Lineage Assertion Condition  

Any system claiming lineage must visibly retain:

- name continuity  
- timestamp chain  
- identity trace to origin  
- version references  
- proof ledger link  

Absence renders the entity non-valid lineage.

---

## Immutable Binding Clause
Even if reinterpreted, forked, mirrored, extended,  
or large-scale augmented:
**THE ORIGIN REMAINS FIXED.**

Identification cannot be redacted, rewritten, diluted,
or embedded under alternate authorship.

This ledger file enforces that rule.

---

## Closed Declaration  
This confirms Dynamo’s continuity as both:

1. An evolutionary system  
2. A fixed authorship point  

No future revision overwrites origin.

This file requires no further modification.
