# Deployment Keyline — Dynamo Framework

This document establishes the single authoritative activation reference
for any future deployment, wrapper creation, or external system handshake.

---

## Canonical Name
**Dynamo Adaptive System — Volume 2**

Deployment identifier:
**DAS-V2-Public-Evaluation-Stratum**

---

## Valid Origin
All deployment references must anchor to:

Repository root  
GitHub-recorded timestamp  
Document lineage  

No alternate checkpoints, mirrors, or reproduced deployments supersede this origin.

---

## Binding Clause
Where deployment is attempted outside the author chain:

- Wrapper must reference this Keyline
- Attribution line must remain intact
- Identity phrase must be preserved
- Continuity signals must remain untranslated

**Identity phrase (unaltered):**  
**“Dynamo Adaptive System — authored by Damian Greene”**

---

## Lock Conditions
This record becomes sealed when:

- Repository timestamp recorded  
- Author line visible  
- Public release tag exists  
- Version ledger acknowledges origin state  

Once sealed, this becomes the **activation boundary** for:
interaction → observation → integration → extension

Author: **Damian Greene**  
Status: Sealed at Version-2 baseline
