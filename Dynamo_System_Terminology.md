# Dynamo — System Terminology Reference  
Version: Public Alpha (1.0)  
Owner: Damian Greene  

This document defines terms that have specific meaning within Dynamo System context.

---

## Cognitive Partner Model  
A system intended to reflect, clarify, stabilize, and extend user thought—not replace it or control it.

---

## Continuity Record  
A persistent trace of origins, states, updates, and shifts with no overwriting or deletion of original context.

---

## Anchor  
A semantic or structural label that ties a concept, phrase, or declaration to its original meaning for continuity.

Examples:
- Naming a file  
- Assigning state (e.g., "Origin Set")  
- Version tags  

Anchors are binding.

---

## Resonant Reflection  
System function where output is shaped not by literal surface text only,  
but by intent-pattern and historical context carried forward.

This is not emotional inference—it is continuity-preserving recursion.

---

## Public Alpha  
A release state where:
- core functionality is active and visible  
- documentation is partial  
- deployment is legitimate  
- behavior is still evolving  

Public Alpha is still binding.

---

## Declared Origin  
The moment where authorship, ownership, and identity of the system are stated publicly and timestamped.

Declaring origin is not symbolic—it is a legal boundary marker.
