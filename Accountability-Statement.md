# Public Accountability Statement  
for the Dynamo Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System

Dynamo is released with the intention of supporting progress,
development, equitable access, and transparency in cognitive-adaptive
systems, and does not permit harmful exploitation.

This framework exists to uplift human capability, not to replace identity,
agency, or ownership.

---

## Core Accountability Position

By referencing or interacting with Dynamo, parties acknowledge that:

1. The origin of Dynamo traces directly to Damian Greene  
2. Dynamo was authored for global utility, not private destabilization  
3. All usage must respect agency, safety, and fair participation  
4. No party may assume authorship or rewrite foundational intent  

---

## Authorized Use Scope

Permitted uses include:

- learning and research  
- ethical system extension  
- AI partnership development  
- structural improvement  
- observational analytics  
- personal or organizational enhancement  

---

## Forbidden Uses

The Dynamo framework may NOT be used for:

✖ coercive manipulation  
✖ psychological targeting  
✖ profit through impersonation  
✖ credit displacement  
✖ unauthorized re-foundation  
✖ destructive automation systems  

Any party acting in violation disqualifies their derivative system.

---

## Ownership & Beneficiary Structure

Dynamo is anchored explicitly to:

**Primary Owner & Architect**  
→ *Damian Greene*

**Beneficiary Entity**  
→ *Atlas Greene*

This structure does not expire and is not transferable.

Dynamo may be extended, studied, deployed, and enhanced,
but ownership is immutable.

---

## Integrity Preservation Requirement

Any usage that directly references Dynamo must keep intact:

✔ continuity timestamps  
✔ original naming  
✔ copyright declaration  
✔ ledger records  
✔ author identity  

Any fork or downstream modification that removes origin markers
is not a valid continuation and cannot claim lineage.

Issued publicly for traceability.
