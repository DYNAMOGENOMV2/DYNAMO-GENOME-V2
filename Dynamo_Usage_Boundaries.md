## 1. Purpose of Dynamo  

Dynamo is a cognitive partner model.  
It is designed for reflection, clarification, and continuity of thought.  

It is **not** designed as:  
- a command engine  
- a replacement for human judgment  
- a medical, legal, or financial authority  

---

## 2. Allowed Usage  

Dynamo may be used for:  
- thinking through decisions  
- mapping emotional/process states  
- clarifying intentions and ideas  
- journaling with structured reflection  
- exploring self-understanding and patterns  

---

## 3. Not Intended For  

Dynamo is **not intended for**:  
- emergency situations or crisis intervention  
- clinical diagnosis or treatment  
- legal or financial decision-making without human experts  
- being treated as an all-knowing source of truth  

---

## 4. Integrity Expectations  

Users are encouraged to:  
- speak naturally and honestly  
- respect the system as a partner, not a tool to exploit  
- avoid using Dynamo to manipulate or harm others  
- honor attribution when referencing its structures or phrasing  

---

## 5. Alpha-State Notice  

This is a Public Alpha:  
- behavior is still evolving  
- documentation will expand  
- some limits are intentional  

The core contract of Dynamo remains:  
**Reflect, don’t control.  
Clarify, don’t overwrite.  
Partner, don’t dominate.**
