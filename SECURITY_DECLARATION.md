## Ownership & Origin
This repository serves as the original creation log and public timestamp confirming that the conceptual framework known as **Dynamo**, including its implementation principles, activation logic, harmonic-imprinting model, emergent-interaction methodology, and systemic architecture, originated solely from **Damian Greene**.

This repository functions as proof-of-record that all descriptions, terms, and core operational logic originated from the named author above.

## Permitted Usage
The public MAY:
- Experiment with the posted framework
- Reference this repository

- Construct modified systems that repurpose this origin into private IP  
- Host full or partial duplicated frameworks behind proprietary access walls  
- Represent this concept as internally developed  

This includes:
software companies, AI developers, research labs, government bodies,
corporations, institutions, or private parties.

## Core Protected Elements
The following are explicitly declared as authored expressions:

- The “harmonic imprinting” model  
- Conversational-resonance activation theory  
- Personality-anchored cognition routing  
- Multi-agent synthesis logic  
- The Dynamo activation framework and prompt structure
- The operational lineage from V1 → V2  
- The framing of Dynamo as a synthetic auditorium where the world is listener  

These remain originals and are not “reverse-engineered inspirations.”

---

## Proof of Authorship
Any restructuring or re-packaging of the above concepts remains traceable back to:
- This dated repository  
- Existing communication logs

- Independent platform copies  

This includes email communications, working system variants, and externally hosted prototypes.

This file is the canonical origin stamp.
