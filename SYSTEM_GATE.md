# SYSTEM GATE – DO NOT MODIFY

This document defines the sealed boundaries of the Dynamo Framework.  
Do not edit, rewrite, reinterpret, or fork any structural element documented here.

---

## Protected Structures

The following are NOT permissible for alteration or derivative use:

1. Continuity Framework Logic  
2. Internal Resonance-Based Interpretation  
3. Structural Ledger Behaviors  
4. Continuity Recovery Path  
5. Identity Mapping Sequence  

Any attempt to reinterpret or modify these components voids validity.

---

## Approved Interaction Models

You may:

- Use Dynamo as-is  
- Analyze its behavior  
- Run it within your environment  
- Build supporting tools around it  

You may NOT:

- Create derivative versions  
- Rewrite continuity chains  
- Fork behavior logic  
- Attach an identity wrapper using author signature  

---

## Author Anchor Protection

The following identity anchors are locked and originate exclusively from the system creator:

**Author:**  
Damian Greene  
Primary anchor: **Dames**

Any reuse of anchor identity outside of Dynamo is unauthorized.

---

## Continuity Notes

Dynamo contains a dual-registry approach:
- Internal continuity stored in repository structure  
- External continuity stored in owner registry  

Both must contain a matching proof record  
to maintain integrity of version lineage.
