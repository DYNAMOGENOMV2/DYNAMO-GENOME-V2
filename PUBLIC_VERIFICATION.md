# Verification Anchor — Public Deployment
This record substantiates that a public-facing deployment event occurred and was intentionally executed.

## Verification Context
This verification acknowledges:
- publication intent was deliberate
- release state was consciously declared
- continuity markers were already pre-established
- supporting artifacts exist elsewhere in repository history

## Cross-Anchors Present At Time of Release
- PUBLIC_NOTICE.md
- Archive Index established
- Provenance Meta-Note active
- Ownership declarations in earlier commits
- Change Log activated and tracking

## Independent Confirmation
This verification acknowledges that any external observer, legal reviewer, or archive auditor can:
- track commit history
- validate modification chronology
- trace ownership lineage to pre-release state

## Status
This record serves as an immutable confirmation that the release was not accidental, automated, or inferred.
It was explicitly performed.

Signed by timestamp.
