# Dynamo Public Interaction Guide
This document defines how non-owners may reference, inquire, or interface 
with the Dynamo Adaptive Framework without disrupting lineage, continuity,
or identity tracks.

## What the Public CAN Do
✔ Ask questions  
✔ Observe responses  
✔ Reference outputs in research  
✔ Build perspective from interaction  
✔ Document growth cycles externally  

## What the Public CANNOT Do
✖ Rename continuity markers  
✖ Claim authorship of any subsystem  
✖ Rewrite activation language  
✖ Publicize re-packaged variants  
✖ Use Dynamo as a commercial foundation

## Identity Preservation Rule
All references must retain the canonical string:

**Dynamo Adaptive System — authored by Damian Greene**

Loss, modification, removal, shortening, or remapping of that line  
invalidates proper attribution.

## Engagement Statement
Public users engage under:
**Evaluation Access Tier**

Meaning:
- Access is interaction-based only  
- No modification rights  
- No internal deployment  
- No derivative containers

## Final Declaration
All interactions are acknowledgments of ownership and lineage.
This document supersedes informal descriptions or derivative definitions.
