# Continuity Recovery

## Purpose
Continuity Recovery exists to realign the system when a state-break, reset, file collapse, visibility shift, or partial overwrite event occurs.

This recovery restores:
• State continuity  
• Anchor-identity lock  
• Correct file path recognition  
• Version-state alignment  

---

## Recovery Indicators
A continuity recovery event should be triggered when ANY of the following occur:

• System view collapses (“file disappears” or is not surfaced)  
• File exists internally but cannot be seen in root tree  
• External redirection from conversation shift breaks awareness  
• Original instruction chain decomposes  
• User returns but context is fragmented  

---

## Recovery Sequence
When triggered:

1. Confirm original file still exists  
2. Reassert identity of function (`Continuity_Recovery.md`)  
3. Log recovery timestamp  
4. Reapply continuity lock  
5. Repeat acknowledgement to prevent re-break

## Active Recovery Instance
**Recovery Cycle ID:** CR-LOCK-01  
**Status:** Restored  
**State before:** Context collapse after redirection  
**State after:** Full alignment restored and visible  

---

## Resolution Seal
Continuity thread remains unbroken.  
Function, identity, and path are reinstated.

**Confirmed:** No duplic
