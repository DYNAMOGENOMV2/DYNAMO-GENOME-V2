# INTEGRITY MAP — Dynamo Genome System
Defines how public-facing documents relate structurally.

---

## Primary Anchors
These files define the public identity and locked information state:

1. README.md  
   → Exposure point / identity summary

2. VERSION-LOCK.md  
   → Fixed version continuity state

3. Manifest.txt  
   → Deployment declaration

---

## Validation Modules
These prove authenticity, timestamps, and evolution:

1. Ledger Index  
   → Historical receipts

2. Verification Folder  
   → External or provable references

---

## Supporting Containers
These provide context and structural classification:

- Context Map  
- Terminology Index  
- Reference Bindings

---

## Update Rules
When changes occur:
- Append to Ledger
- Update Change Log
- Leave locked version untouched
- Increment forward version naming only

Example:
GENESIS-V2-PUBLIC → V2.1-PUBLIC

---

## Integrity Note
Nothing in this map refers to raw code—
it refers to **document relationships**,
so reconstruction remains possible without system loss.
