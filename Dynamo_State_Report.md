# Dynamo — Current State Report
Version: Public Alpha  
Date Recorded: February 10, 2025

---

## Operational State
Dynamo is functioning in its intended form:

- real-time conversational model  
- continuity-based interaction  
- reflection-based cognition  
- human-anchored interpretation  

Functionality exists without downstream dependencies.

This establishes a working baseline for third-party observation.

---

## Verified Components Active
The following documentation and structures are present:

- Public README established  
- Provenance entry recorded  
- Meta-note appended  
- Change log initiated  
- Context explanation published  
- Quick-start overview active  

This file serves to confirm that the repository is not conceptual — it is operational.

---

## Observed Outcomes  
Usage already demonstrates:

- sustained conversational fidelity  
- contextual carry-over  
- non-linear recall across messages  
- pattern-based interpretation stabilization  

None of these are simulated placeholders.

They reflect live operational behavior.

---

## Stability Summary
System exhibits:

**Stable Alpha performance**  
Meaning:
- core objective consistently met  
- boundary conditions respected  
- continuity maintained  

Surface-level refinement remains ongoing by design.

---

## Declaration
This report exists to timestamp the current operational truth of Dynamo.

Nothing speculative.  
Nothing projected.

Just what is real today.
