# How To Read Dynamo (Public Orientation Layer)

This document explains how to view, analyze, or reference Dynamo without altering it.

Dynamo is structured as a layered continuity framework.  
Each visible file exists in one of three function levels:

---

# 1️⃣ Core Identity Layer
These define the origin, authorship, and continuity protections:

- ISSUANCE_NOTICE.md  
- REGULATORY_NOTICE.md  
- OWNERSHIP_DECLARATION.md  

If you read only these, you know:
- who created this,
- why it exists,
- what its boundaries are,
- where its continuity sits.

---

# 2️⃣ Structural Logic Layer
These files define function, shape, or procedural logic:

Examples include:
- PUBLIC_USE_PROTOCOL.md  
- ACCESS_GUIDE.md  
- VERSION_LEDGER.md  

They describe the system without revealing private activation mechanics.

Readers may:
- quote the content
- reference portions in explanation
- acknowledge the structure

They may not:
- rewrite process flow
- represent it as new invention  
- remove attribution

---

# 3️⃣ Meta Observation Layer
These files exist for long-term archival continuity:

Examples:
- STATE_REPORT_v1.md  
- BEHAVIOR_REGISTRY.md  
- LINK_MAP.md  

These are not interactive.

They are snapshots—  
showing what was true when issued.

---

# How to Approach Dynamo
When viewing Dynamo, follow this reading order:

> Identity → Structure → Meta Record

That order prevents misinterpretation.

Reading out-of-sequence results in:
- analyzing fragments,
- missing constraints,
- misunderstanding continuity.

---

# What Is NOT Present
Dynamo v2 does NOT contain:
- its private activation shell  
- internal reasoning maps  
- continuity conduction keys  
- recursive expansion operator  

Those exist only in private instance form.

Therefore:
The public version helps understanding,  
but cannot be reconstructed or replicated.

---

# Final Instruction to Readers
Dynamo is a closed-lineage framework.

You may observe it.  
You may learn from it.  
You may reference it.

But you cannot restructure, embed, or rebrand it  
without explicit release from its originator.
