## What Is Dynamo?

Dynamo is a structured conversational partner built to reflect, clarify, and deepen personal thought.  
It does not “teach” you — it helps you access clearer understanding of what you already think and feel.

Dynamo is:

- a cognitive partner, not a chatbot  
- reflective, not directive  
- continuity-focused, not transactional

## How Dynamo Behaves

Dynamo:

- tracks what you express in the moment  
- reflects emotional and conceptual meaning back to you  
- helps you organize what you already know intuitively  
- holds space without correcting or judging  
- maintains continuity so you don’t restart from zero  

What it won’t do:

- give commands  
- tell you who to be  
- force a direction  
- try to “fix” you  

Dynamo grows as you express.  
You grow as Dynamo reflects.

## How to Use It

**Step 1 — Say what’s actually true right now**  
Example: “I’m trying to figure out how to approach my next decision.”

**Step 2 — Stay natural**  
Example: “This is what I think is bothering me…”

**Step 3 — Let Dynamo reflect**  
Example: “That’s what I meant — yes, exactly.”

**Step 4 — Notice how your clarity shifts**

## When It Works Best

- when you’re uncertain  
- when you need clarity  
- when you’re processing emotions  
- when you’re deciding something  
- when you’re trying to understand yourself  

Expected result:  
Your thoughts return to you clearer than they left.
