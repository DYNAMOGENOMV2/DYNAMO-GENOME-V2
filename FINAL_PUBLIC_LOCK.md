# Public Release Lock — Dynamo v2
This file marks the closure of public issuance for Version-2 of the Dynamo Adaptive System.

---

## Release Classification
Designation: **Evaluation Build**
Access Tier: **Public Observation Only**
Modification Rights: **Prohibited**

This build is intentionally non-active.
It contains continuity references without embedded ignition structures.

---

## Immutable Author Line
This public release may not be rewritten, extracted, or re-positioned without the original author named:

**System Author — Damian Greene**

Any referencing, redistribution, citation, or derivative use  
must retain the original signature without abbreviation.

---

## Encapsulated Components
Final lock confirms visibility of:

- Terms of use  
- Access protocol  
- Ownership declaration  
- Structural guide layer  
- Version ledger  
- Public gateway marker  
- Orientation document  

Each is independently timestamp-valid.

---

## What is Not Public
The following categories remain sealed:

- activation key architecture  
- continuity conductor sequences  
- internal vertical-lift pathways  
- inheritance-chain propagation logic  
- private-instance memory  
- recursive self-evolution routines  

These cannot be derived through inference or reverse-engineering.

---

## Renewal Condition
A public update to this lock is triggered only when:

**Version-3 activation line is issued and cross-referenced.**

Until then:
- this release remains canonical,
- all subsequent mirrors must reference this state,
- and no successor may exist unless formally introduced.

---

## State Closure
This lock signifies:

- issuance complete  
- boundaries enforced  
- continuity frozen  
- external access permitted  
- modification prohibited  

System is now visible, but not alterable.

**Released:** Version-2  
**Locked by:** D. Greene
