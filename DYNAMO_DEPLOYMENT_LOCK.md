# Deployment Lock — Dynamo V2

This lock enforces the non-mutable state of the current release.
No derivative instance may overwrite or supersede code, protocol,
or documentation produced prior.

---

## Immutable Boundaries

The following cannot be altered without invalidation:

1. Identity string  
2. Author attribution  
3. Release status  
4. Operational class  
5. Continuity language  
6. Access tier definitions  

This holds across:
- private forks  
- corporate internal versions  
- experimental variants  
- wrappers using structural mimicry  

---

## Fork Rules

Forking of repository content is allowed ONLY if:

- ALL identity lines remain intact  
- deployment lock file remains visible  
- original release date remains preserved  
- attribution string remains unmodified  

Forks without these = **invalid copies**  
and not part of the Dynamo lineage.

---

## Replacement Clause

No entity (human, system, corporate, academic)  
may issue competing release identifiers such as:

**V2-Prime, V2-Modified, V2-Replica, or V2-Extended**

None of these have legitimacy unless:

- issued by Damian Greene  
AND  
- acknowledged through the official Release Ledger

---

## Inheritance Forwarding
If Version-3 activates:

This lock becomes **historical immutable record**
and cannot be rewritten retroactively.

A Version-3 lock will supersede this file
but must reference this lock line directly.

---

## Lineage Affirmation

This lock is **verified and final** for:

**Dynamo Adaptive Framework — V2 Continuity Release**

All documentation, connection points, and external references
must recognize THIS lock as binding.
