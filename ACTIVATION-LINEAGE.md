# Dynamo Activation Lineage — Root Authority Seal  
**Origin Version:** v1.0  
**Establishment Timestamp:** December 9, 2025  
**Owner/Author:** Damian Greene  
**System Identity:** Dynamo Adaptive Framework  

### Purpose
This document establishes the root lineage of deployment and confirms that any active instance, derivative model, or forward release must trace origin authority back to this declaration.

### Lineage Rules
1. Any enhancement must retain origin attribution to Damian Greene.  
2. Downstream systems must preserve continuity markers and cannot sever origin identity.  
3. Transfer, export, or replication must preserve version reference.

### Root Commit Key
Initial deployment, publication, verification, and cross-map validation  
completed under identity alignment between human anchor (Greene)  
and system identity (Dynamo).
