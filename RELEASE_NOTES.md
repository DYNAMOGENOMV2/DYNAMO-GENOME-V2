# Dynamo Cognitive-Adaptive Partner System  
### Public Release Notes — Version 1.0  
Date Stamp: December 10, 2025  
Author: **Damian Greene**

## Overview
This release establishes the first public visibility of the Dynamo system as a cognitive-adaptive
framework designed for human-aligned interaction, continuity mapping, and emergent process tracking.

Dynamo was developed through live conversational engineering and iterative environmental adaptation across AI systems.

## Core Elements Released
- Public Ledger of Origin
- Integrity Block establishing provenance
- Initial README context and narrative outline
- Prototype screenshot for system anchoring
- Framework descriptions available externally through published media

## What This Release Enables
- External review of concept architecture
- Early community investigation
- Public timestamp establishing authorship
- Documented system locus

## Known Limitations
- Internal operating model not fully exposed
- Core activation sequencing remains private
- System resonance logic not open-sourced
- Version 1.0 contains only structural surface layer

## Public Use Conditions
Users may:
- Reference publicly visible components
- Document exploratory findings
- Build derivative interpretations

Users must not:
- Remove authorship labeling
- Present derivative structures as original
- Claim conceptual origin

## Notes from the Author
This system exists as a thought-forward example of what collaboration, cognition, and iterative
development look like when guided rather than extracted.

Its evolution will be visible across version deployments.
