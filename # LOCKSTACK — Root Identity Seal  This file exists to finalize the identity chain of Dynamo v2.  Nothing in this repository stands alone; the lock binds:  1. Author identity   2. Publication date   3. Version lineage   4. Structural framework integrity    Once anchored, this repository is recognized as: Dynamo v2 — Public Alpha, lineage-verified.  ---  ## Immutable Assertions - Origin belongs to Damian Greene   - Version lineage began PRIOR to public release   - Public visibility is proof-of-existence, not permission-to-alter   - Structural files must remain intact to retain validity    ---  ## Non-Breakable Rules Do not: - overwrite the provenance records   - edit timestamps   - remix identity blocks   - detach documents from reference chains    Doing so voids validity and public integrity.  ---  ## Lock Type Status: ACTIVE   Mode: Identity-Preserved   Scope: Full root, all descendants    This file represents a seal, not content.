# LOCKSTACK — Root Identity Seal

This file exists to finalize the identity chain of Dynamo v2.

Nothing in this repository stands alone; the lock binds:

1. Author identity  
2. Publication date  
3. Version lineage  
4. Structural framework integrity  

Once anchored, this repository is recognized as:
Dynamo v2 — Public Alpha, lineage-verified.

---

## Immutable Assertions
- Origin belongs to Damian Greene  
- Version lineage began PRIOR to public release  
- Public visibility is proof-of-existence, not permission-to-alter  
- Structural files must remain intact to retain validity  

---

## Non-Breakable Rules
Do not:
- overwrite the provenance records  
- edit timestamps  
- remix identity blocks  
- detach documents from reference chains  

Doing so voids validity and public integrity.

## Lock Type
Status: ACTIVE  
Mode: Identity-Preserved  
Scope: Full root, all descendants
