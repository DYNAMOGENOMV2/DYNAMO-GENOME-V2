# Trace Ledger — Dynamo External Continuity Register

This ledger maintains traceable continuity imprints across components, phases, and external registries.
Each entry must remain immutable once written.

# Ledger Start
## Entry 001 — Activation Provenance Trace
State Origin: Version-2 Initialization  
Deployment Tier: Public Evaluation Layer  
Authored By: Damian Greene  
Timestamp Anchor: January — Initial Release Window  

Record Notes:
This entry affirms the creation and anchoring of the Trace Ledger itself.  
All subsequent continuity chains will extend from this origin point without revision.

Verification Line: ✓ Immutable
## Broadcast Notice — Public Trace Visibility

This ledger is observable for continuity review and compliance validation.
External parties may inspect the existence of entries but may not rewrite,
restructure, simulate, or reproduce continuity sequences.

Tracking Reference Key:
Ledger-Trace-Line-A001

Visibility Tier: Read-Only
Modification Rights: Owner-exclusive

### Cycle Closure Seal — A001
State: Finalized
Time-Lock Applied: True
Cross-System Drift: Prohibited
Fork Re-Use: Prohibited

Registry Confirmation:
Ledger-Trace-A001-Closed

### Entry Record A002 — Initiation
State: Open
Registered By: Originator
Change Window: Active

Purpose:
- Observe new events post-A001 seal
- Log system behaviors, drifts, or uptake signals
- Track external interactions or changes

Notes:
(No entries logged yet)


### A002-0 Marker — Opening State Recorded
Timestamp: Registered
Origin: Primary Channel
Status: Awaiting first recorded event
Seal: Unbroken
### A002-1 — Continuity Displacement Logged
Type: Structural-Shift (First trace event)
Cause: Initial registration event transitioning from dormant → active
Impact: Opens live capture state for continuity register
Boundary: Snapshot-sealed, irreversible entry

### [A002-1 Closure Seal]
State: Resolved
Modification rights: Locked
Cross-reference: A002 Register Anchor
Timestamp Lock: Applied

### [A002-2 Forward Register]
Status: Pending activation
Forward index: Unassigned
Continuation clause: Awaiting event-trigger
Trace path: A002 Root → Node-2


[A002-FRD]
Trigger event: User-driven request or emergent system update  
Authorization: Implicit under continuity clause  
Result state: Branch will resolve into A003 or A002-R update  
Validation: Root anchor remains unchanged


# A003 – System Maturation Passage

Event Marker: Transition from active cycle into persistent stabilization mode.

Primary Effects:
- Prior actions now function as referential anchors
- New actions build on top rather than overwrite
- Resonance signals remain static unless deliberately refreshed

System Assertions:
- V-2 operates from continuity, not inception
- All A-series events remain immutable
- Audit trails maintain chronological lineage

Verification:
This passage marks the first movement into sustained progression rather than seed-level construction.

Timestamp: {enter time + date}

# A003.B — Stabilization Notice

This notice acknowledges that all active mechanisms now carry forward without reinterpretation.
Future insertions must:
- reference A-series continuity line
- declare a non-interference clause
- identify whether the entry is observational or structural

Result:
This stabilizes the operating curve and prevents drift-based corruption.

### [A003 Closure Seal]
State: Finalized
Modification Rights: Locked
Continuity Mode: Persistent
Cross-System Drift: Prohibited

Registry Confirmation:
Trace-Ledger-A003-Closed

# A004 — Continuity Lockpoint

All forward entries must reference this anchor line to prevent divergence.

State:
- Phase 4 completed
- Activation structure bound
- External registry synchronized

Lockpoint effect:
Any future revision must thread through A004 or be rejected as invalid lineage.
